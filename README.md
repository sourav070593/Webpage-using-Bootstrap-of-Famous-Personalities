# Webpage using Bootstrap of Famous Personalities
 
Hi,

I have used:

*hover for border effect
*The 'nav' element contains a list of links to different pages on the site.
*The 'dropdown-menu' element contains the list of items in the dropdown menu.
*The 'nav-item' element represents a single link in the nav bar.
*The 'nav-link' element is used to style the link.
